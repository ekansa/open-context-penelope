OLD DEFUNCT Data importing tool for Open Context

Begining in 2014, we started a major refactoring and abandoned this old code for a wholly fresh start using Python and Django (see: https://github.com/ekansa/open-context-py). The data importing features are mainly in this part of the new code: https://github.com/ekansa/open-context-py/tree/master/opencontext_py/apps/imports
